                We created InShape to help college students, like ourselves, find ways to be healthy that did not solely revolve around 
                exercise, or lack thereof. There are so many components to leading a healthy lifestyle - why not understand them all? 
                </p>

                <p className = "OurMissionText2">
                As busy college students, we understand that there are days where you can’t find time to make it to the gym. Sometimes, 
                busy schedules prevent us from getting to the gym for multiple days at a time. You don’t want to feel gross and groggy 
                simply because you didn’t hit your exercise goal, do you? How can we lead healthy lifestyles without exclusively focusing 
                on activity levels? 
                </p>

                <p className = "OurMissionText3">
                This is where a complete healthy lifestyle matters. Being “healthy” does not just mean working out. Leading a healthy 
                lifestyle also incorporates nutrition. Our goal is to provide individuals with foods, recipes, and exercises that pertain 
                to the individual. No two bodies are the same, which means that no two people need to eat the same foods or exercise the 
                same way every day.

                It is possible to change your body through just your diet without exercise, but this does not create a healthy body and 
                lifestyle. A healthy diet does not only help you look good, but also helps you feel good. Eating the right foods for your
                body provides energy and fuel. Your energy will be more sustainable if you eat foods that contain the vitamins your body 
                needs rather than crashing from eating only a doughnut for breakfast.
